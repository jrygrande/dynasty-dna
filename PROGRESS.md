# Dynasty DNA - Implementation Progress Tracker

## üìà Overall Progress Status
**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Transaction Graph Implementation  
**Completion:** API & Data Sync Complete ‚úÖ | Transaction Graph Partial Fix üîß

### üéØ Latest Milestone Achieved
‚úÖ **Transaction Graph API Implemented** - Complete transaction graph visualization with recursive asset tracing, but draft pick associations need comprehensive fix for full accuracy.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Next Step
**Fix Database Data Completeness** - See `backend/DATABASE_FIX_PLAN.md` for comprehensive solution to sync all missing data:
- Historical draft data (2021 startup + all rookie drafts)
- Complete matchup results (all weeks, not just week 1)
- NFL state for game timing
- Player weekly scores from matchups

**Note:** The draft pick graph fix documented in `DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md` will be addressed AFTER database completeness is resolved.

### üöÄ Development Environment Status
- **Backend API:** Running on http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend App:** Running on http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ  
- **Database:** SQLite with Prisma migrations applied ‚úÖ
- **Repository:** All foundation code committed and pushed ‚úÖ

## Current Sprint Focus
**Goal:** Fix database data completeness issues
**Target Completion:** September 5-6, 2025
**Next Steps:** 
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Fix database completeness (see DATABASE_FIX_PLAN.md)
   - Sync all historical drafts (2021-2025)
   - Sync all matchup weeks (not just week 1)
   - Populate NFL state data
   - Extract player weekly scores
2. üîß Fix draft pick data model associations (see DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md)
3. ‚úÖ Transaction graph API implementation - COMPLETED
4. ‚úÖ Recursive asset tracing - COMPLETED  
5. Then proceed to frontend visualizations

## Notes & Decisions
- **Database Choice:** SQLite selected for simplicity and free deployment
- **ORM Choice:** Prisma for type safety and excellent SQLite support
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement 100ms delays between API calls (600 req/min buffer)
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache everything except current week transactions during season
- **Test Data:** Using Dynasty Domination league for development and testing
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Sleeper matchups endpoint provides individual player fantasy points - no external data sources needed!

## Blockers & Risks
- **Database Completeness Issues:** Multiple critical data gaps discovered
  - Missing all 2021 draft data (startup year)
  - Matchups only have week 1 data for all seasons
  - NFLState table is completely empty
  - No player weekly scoring data
  - Solution documented in DATABASE_FIX_PLAN.md
- **Draft Pick Data Model Issue:** Current implementation only tracks traded picks
  - Causes incorrect associations in transaction graphs
  - Will be addressed after database completeness fix
  - Solution documented in DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md

## Success Metrics
- Successfully visualize transaction chains for test league
- Load full league history in < 5 seconds
- Mobile-responsive transaction tree visualization
- Clear UI requiring no documentation for basic use
