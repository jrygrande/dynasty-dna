# Dynasty DNA - Implementation Progress Tracker

## üìà Overall Progress Status
**Last Updated:** September 6, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1.5 - Data Validation & Integrity Verification  
**Completion:** API & Data Sync Complete ‚úÖ | Database Completeness Fixed ‚úÖ | Draft Pick System Rebuilt ‚úÖ | Ready for Validation

### üéØ Latest Milestone Achieved
‚úÖ **Draft Pick System Completely Rebuilt** - Comprehensive fix achieved with 100% data integrity (September 6, 2025):
- ‚úÖ **336 draft picks created** (192 historical + 144 future) with correct ownership logic
- ‚úÖ **Zero NULL values** in completed draft seasons (2022-2025) 
- ‚úÖ **Perfect ownership chains** using actual draft order instead of rosterId assumptions
- ‚úÖ **254 traded picks applied** accurately across all dynasty seasons

### üîç Next Phase Required
**Data Validation & Integrity Verification** - Before proceeding to visualizations, comprehensive validation needed to ensure:
- All ownership chains are complete from asset creation to current owner
- Draft integrity (picks used only once, correct chronological order)
- Transaction temporal consistency and single-owner constraints
- Historical roster states match transaction history perfectly

### üöÄ Development Environment Status
- **Backend API:** Running on http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend App:** Running on http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ  
- **Database:** SQLite with Prisma migrations applied ‚úÖ
- **Repository:** All foundation code committed and pushed ‚úÖ

## Phase 1.5: Data Validation & Integrity Verification (September 6, 2025)

### üîç Critical Validation Required
Before proceeding to frontend visualizations, we must verify data integrity to ensure accurate transaction chain analysis:

#### ‚úÖ Completed Data Fixes
- [x] Draft pick system completely rebuilt with correct logic
- [x] Database completeness issues resolved (30,765+ player scores)
- [x] Dynasty continuity across all historical seasons
- [x] Ownership logic corrected using actual draft order

#### üìä Validation Requirements  
- [ ] **Ownership Chain Completeness**
  - [ ] Every asset has clear path from creation to current owner
  - [ ] No orphaned assets or broken ownership chains
  - [ ] All trades have both sides properly recorded

- [ ] **Draft Pick Integrity**
  - [ ] Draft order consistency - picks used only once per draft
  - [ ] No duplicate player selections across league history
  - [ ] All completed drafts result in full rosters

- [ ] **Transaction Temporal Consistency**
  - [ ] All transactions have valid timestamps and involved parties
  - [ ] Transactions occur in chronological order within each season
  - [ ] No future-dated transactions in historical data

- [ ] **Single Owner Constraint**
  - [ ] At any point in time, each asset has exactly one owner
  - [ ] No simultaneous ownership conflicts in transaction history
  - [ ] Roster limits respected at all transaction points

- [ ] **Historical State Validation**
  - [ ] Historical roster states consistent with transaction history
  - [ ] Process entire transaction histories and verify final states match current rosters
  - [ ] Trade balances (assets given = assets received) for all transactions

#### üõ†Ô∏è Validation Scripts Needed
- [ ] Create `validateOwnershipChains.ts` - Trace all assets from origin to current state
- [ ] Create `validateDraftIntegrity.ts` - Verify draft pick usage and player selections
- [ ] Create `validateTemporalOrder.ts` - Check chronological consistency and timestamps
- [ ] Create `validateSingleOwner.ts` - Ensure no simultaneous ownership conflicts
- [ ] Create `validateHistoricalStates.ts` - Verify roster states match transaction history
- [ ] Update existing `validateGraph.ts` with comprehensive integrity checks

#### üéØ Success Criteria
- **100% ownership chain completeness** - No orphaned or untraced assets
- **Zero draft integrity violations** - All picks used correctly and chronologically  
- **Perfect temporal consistency** - All transactions in proper chronological order
- **No ownership conflicts** - Single owner constraint maintained throughout history
- **Historical accuracy** - Final states exactly match transaction-derived states
