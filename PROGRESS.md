# Dynasty DNA - Implementation Progress Tracker

## üìà Overall Progress Status
**Last Updated:** September 5, 2025

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Next Step
**Fix Draft Pick Data Model** - See `backend/DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md` for comprehensive solution to ensure accurate draft pick associations without manual database fixes.

### üöÄ Development Environment Status
- **Backend API:** Running on http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend App:** Running on http://localhost:5173 ‚úÖ  
- **Database:** SQLite with Prisma migrations applied ‚úÖ
- **Repository:** All foundation code committed and pushed ‚úÖ

  - [x] `syncTradedPicks(leagueId)` - Draft pick trades
  - [x] `syncUsers(leagueId)` - League users
- [x] Test with Dynasty Domination league (ID: 1191596293294166016)

### üîß Transaction Chain Algorithm (Days 5-6) - PARTIAL
- [x] Parse transaction data into graph structure
- [x] Build recursive traversal for trade chains
- [x] Track draft picks through multiple trades
- [x] Create tree structure for visualization
- [x] Handle complex multi-asset trades
- [x] Add unit tests for chain building logic
- [ ] **FIX REQUIRED:** Draft pick associations (see DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md)

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints (Days 7-8) - COMPLETED
- [x] `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- [x] `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/sync` - Trigger data sync
- [x] `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/sync-dynasty` - Sync full dynasty history
- [x] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId/transaction-graph` - Complete transaction graph
- [x] `GET /api/players/:playerId/transaction-chain` - Player trade history
- [x] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId/assets/:assetId/complete-tree` - Full asset tree
- [x] Add API documentation with example responses

### ‚úÖ Frontend Foundation (Days 9-10) - COMPLETED
- [x] Set up React with Vite and TypeScript

- [x] Create routing structure with React Router
- [x] Set up Zustand stores:
  - [x] League store
  - [x] Transaction store
  - [x] UI store (loading, modals, etc.)
- [x] Create API service layer with error handling
- [x] Set up development environment

### üìä Core Visualizations (Days 11-13)
- [ ] **Transaction Chain Tree (D3.js)**
  - [ ] Interactive expanding/collapsing nodes
  - [ ] Color coding by transaction type (trade, waiver, FA)
  - [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities
  - [ ] Tooltip with transaction details
- [ ] **Roster Timeline**
  - [ ] Horizontal timeline showing acquisitions
  - [ ] Hover for transaction details
  - [ ] Filter by acquisition type
- [ ] **Manager Profile**
  - [ ] Current roster with acquisition info
  - [ ] Trade history summary
  - [ ] Draft pick inventory

### üß™ Testing & Polish (Day 14)
- [ ] Test with actual league data
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize API calls and caching
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add basic error boundaries

## Phase 2: Player Scoring & Performance Tracking (Future)

### üìà Sleeper Matchups Integration
- [ ] Implement matchups endpoint integration
- [ ] Sync historical player weekly scoring data from Sleeper matchups
- [ ] Store individual player fantasy points by week/season in database
- [ ] Build comprehensive player performance tracking

### üìä Player Performance Tracking  
- [ ] Use Sleeper's pre-calculated fantasy points (no external calculation needed)
- [ ] Track starter vs bench performance from matchups data
- [ ] Add performance metrics to visualizations
- [ ] Build trade effectiveness analysis using actual fantasy points

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Future)

### üéØ Trade Effectiveness (Moved to Phase 2)
- [ ] Calculate actual points gained/lost in trades using Sleeper scoring data
- [ ] Win contribution analysis
- [ ] Future value assessment for draft picks

### üìã Draft Success Analytics (Moved to Phase 2)
- [ ] Career value of drafted players using Sleeper scoring data
- [ ] Hit rate by round analysis
- [ ] Comparison to league averages using actual fantasy points

## Current Sprint Focus
**Goal:** Fix draft pick data model for accurate associations
**Target Completion:** September 6-7, 2025
**Next Steps:** 
1. ‚úÖ Transaction graph API implementation - COMPLETED
2. ‚úÖ Recursive asset tracing - COMPLETED  
3. üîß Partial fix for draft descriptions and re-acquired picks - COMPLETED
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Implement comprehensive draft pick fix (see DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md)
5. Then proceed to frontend visualizations

## Notes & Decisions
- **Database Choice:** SQLite selected for simplicity and free deployment
- **ORM Choice:** Prisma for type safety and excellent SQLite support
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement 100ms delays between API calls (600 req/min buffer)
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache everything except current week transactions during season
- **Test Data:** Using Dynasty Domination league for development and testing
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Sleeper matchups endpoint provides individual player fantasy points - no external data sources needed!

## Blockers & Risks
- **Draft Pick Data Model Issue:** Current implementation only tracks traded picks, causing incorrect associations
  - Manual database fixes required for accuracy
  - Re-sync would not produce correct data
  - Solution documented in DRAFT_PICK_FIX_PLAN.md

## Success Metrics
- Successfully visualize transaction chains for test league
- Load full league history in < 5 seconds
- Mobile-responsive transaction tree visualization
- Clear UI requiring no documentation for basic use
