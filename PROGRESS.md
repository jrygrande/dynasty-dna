### 📋 Sleeper API Client (Days 3-4)
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for Sleeper API responses
- [ ] Implement base API client with rate limiting (1000 req/min)
- [ ] Add in-memory caching layer
- [ ] Create sync service methods:
  - [ ] `syncLeague(leagueId)` - League metadata
  - [ ] `syncTransactions(leagueId)` - All weeks (1-18)
  - [ ] `syncRosters(leagueId)` - Current rosters
  - [ ] `syncTradedPicks(leagueId)` - Draft pick trades
  - [ ] `syncUsers(leagueId)` - League users
- [ ] Test with Dynasty Domination league (ID: 1191596293294166016)

### 🔗 Transaction Chain Algorithm (Days 5-6)
- [ ] Parse transaction data into graph structure
- [ ] Build recursive traversal for trade chains
- [ ] Track draft picks through multiple trades
- [ ] Create tree structure for D3.js visualization
- [ ] Handle complex multi-asset trades
- [ ] Add unit tests for chain building logic

### 🌐 API Endpoints (Days 7-8)
- [ ] `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- [ ] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueName` - Find league by name
- [ ] `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/sync` - Trigger data sync
- [ ] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions` - Get all transactions
- [ ] `GET /api/players/:playerId/transaction-chain` - Player trade history
- [ ] `GET /api/rosters/:rosterId/acquisition` - How players were acquired
- [ ] `GET /api/draft-picks/:pickId/chain` - Track pick through trades
- [ ] Add API documentation with example responses

### ⚛️ Frontend Foundation (Days 9-10)
- [ ] Set up React with Vite and TypeScript
- [ ] Configure TailwindCSS with design system
- [ ] Create routing structure with React Router
- [ ] Set up Zustand stores:
  - [ ] League store
  - [ ] Transaction store
  - [ ] UI store (loading, modals, etc.)
- [ ] Create API service layer with error handling
- [ ] Set up development environment

### 📊 Core Visualizations (Days 11-13)
- [ ] **Transaction Chain Tree (D3.js)**
  - [ ] Interactive expanding/collapsing nodes
  - [ ] Color coding by transaction type (trade, waiver, FA)
  - [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities
  - [ ] Tooltip with transaction details
- [ ] **Roster Timeline**
  - [ ] Horizontal timeline showing acquisitions
  - [ ] Hover for transaction details
  - [ ] Filter by acquisition type
- [ ] **Manager Profile**
  - [ ] Current roster with acquisition info
  - [ ] Trade history summary
  - [ ] Draft pick inventory

### 🧪 Testing & Polish (Day 14)
- [ ] Test with actual league data
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize API calls and caching
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add basic error boundaries

## Phase 2: Stats Integration & Performance Tracking (Future)

### 📈 nflverse Integration
- [ ] Set up nfl_data_py integration or Node.js equivalent
- [ ] Create player ID mapping between Sleeper and nflverse
- [ ] Implement weekly stats import
- [ ] Build fantasy points calculation engine

### 📊 Player Performance Tracking
- [ ] Calculate historical fantasy points for all players
- [ ] Track starter vs bench performance
- [ ] Add performance metrics to visualizations

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Future)

### 🎯 Trade Effectiveness
- [ ] Calculate actual points gained/lost in trades
- [ ] Win contribution analysis
- [ ] Future value assessment for draft picks

### 📋 Draft Success Analytics
- [ ] Career value of drafted players
- [ ] Hit rate by round analysis
- [ ] Comparison to positional ADP

## Current Sprint Focus
**Goal:** Complete backend foundation and Sleeper API integration
**Target Completion:** End of Week 1
**Next Steps:** 
1. Initialize project structure
2. Set up Prisma with SQLite
3. Build Sleeper API client with rate limiting

## Notes & Decisions
- **Database Choice:** SQLite selected for simplicity and free deployment
- **ORM Choice:** Prisma for type safety and excellent SQLite support
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement 100ms delays between API calls (600 req/min buffer)
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache everything except current week transactions during season
- **Test Data:** Using Dynasty Domination league for development and testing

## Blockers & Risks
- None identified at this time

## Success Metrics
- Successfully visualize transaction chains for test league
- Load full league history in < 5 seconds
- Mobile-responsive transaction tree visualization
- Clear UI requiring no documentation for basic use
