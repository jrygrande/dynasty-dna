### âœ… Backend Foundation (Days 1-2) - COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize Node.js backend with TypeScript
- [x] Set up Express server with middleware (CORS, JSON parsing, error handling)
- [x] Configure Prisma with SQLite
- [x] Create initial database schema
- [x] Run initial migration (`npx prisma migrate dev --name init`)
- [x] Set up environment variables and configuration

### ðŸ”„ Sleeper API Client (Days 3-4)
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for Sleeper API responses
- [ ] Implement base API client with rate limiting (1000 req/min)
- [ ] Add in-memory caching layer
- [ ] Create sync service methods:
  - [ ] `syncLeague(leagueId)` - League metadata
  - [ ] `syncTransactions(leagueId)` - All weeks (1-18)
  - [ ] `syncRosters(leagueId)` - Current rosters
  - [ ] `syncTradedPicks(leagueId)` - Draft pick trades
  - [ ] `syncUsers(leagueId)` - League users
- [ ] Test with Dynasty Domination league (ID: 1191596293294166016)

### ðŸ”— Transaction Chain Algorithm (Days 5-6)
- [ ] Parse transaction data into graph structure
- [ ] Build recursive traversal for trade chains
- [ ] Track draft picks through multiple trades
- [ ] Create tree structure for D3.js visualization
- [ ] Handle complex multi-asset trades
- [ ] Add unit tests for chain building logic

### ðŸ”„ API Endpoints (Days 7-8)
- [x] `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- [ ] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueName` - Find league by name
- [x] `POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/sync` - Trigger data sync (placeholder)
- [x] `GET /api/leagues/:leagueId/transactions` - Get all transactions (placeholder)
- [x] `GET /api/players/:playerId/transaction-chain` - Player trade history (placeholder)
- [ ] `GET /api/rosters/:rosterId/acquisition` - How players were acquired
- [ ] `GET /api/draft-picks/:pickId/chain` - Track pick through trades
- [ ] Add API documentation with example responses

### âœ… Frontend Foundation (Days 9-10) - COMPLETED
- [x] Set up React with Vite and TypeScript
- [x] Configure TailwindCSS with design system
- [x] Create routing structure with React Router
- [x] Set up Zustand stores:
  - [x] League store
  - [x] Transaction store
  - [x] UI store (loading, modals, etc.)
- [x] Create API service layer with error handling
- [x] Set up development environment

### ðŸ“Š Core Visualizations (Days 11-13)
- [ ] **Transaction Chain Tree (D3.js)**
  - [ ] Interactive expanding/collapsing nodes
  - [ ] Color coding by transaction type (trade, waiver, FA)
  - [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities
  - [ ] Tooltip with transaction details
- [ ] **Roster Timeline**
  - [ ] Horizontal timeline showing acquisitions
  - [ ] Hover for transaction details
  - [ ] Filter by acquisition type
- [ ] **Manager Profile**
  - [ ] Current roster with acquisition info
  - [ ] Trade history summary
  - [ ] Draft pick inventory

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Polish (Day 14)
- [ ] Test with actual league data
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize API calls and caching
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add basic error boundaries

## Phase 2: Player Scoring & Performance Tracking (Future)

### ðŸ“ˆ Sleeper Matchups Integration
- [ ] Implement matchups endpoint integration
- [ ] Sync historical player weekly scoring data from Sleeper matchups
- [ ] Store individual player fantasy points by week/season in database
- [ ] Build comprehensive player performance tracking

### ðŸ“Š Player Performance Tracking  
- [ ] Use Sleeper's pre-calculated fantasy points (no external calculation needed)
- [ ] Track starter vs bench performance from matchups data
- [ ] Add performance metrics to visualizations
- [ ] Build trade effectiveness analysis using actual fantasy points

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Future)

### ðŸŽ¯ Trade Effectiveness (Moved to Phase 2)
- [ ] Calculate actual points gained/lost in trades using Sleeper scoring data
- [ ] Win contribution analysis
- [ ] Future value assessment for draft picks

### ðŸ“‹ Draft Success Analytics (Moved to Phase 2)
- [ ] Career value of drafted players using Sleeper scoring data
- [ ] Hit rate by round analysis
- [ ] Comparison to league averages using actual fantasy points

## Current Sprint Focus
**Goal:** Implement Sleeper API integration and transaction chain algorithm
**Target Completion:** End of Week 1
**Next Steps:** 
1. âœ… Initialize project structure - COMPLETED
2. âœ… Set up Prisma with SQLite - COMPLETED  
3. ðŸ”„ Build Sleeper API client with rate limiting - IN PROGRESS
4. Build transaction chain parsing algorithm
5. Implement core visualization components

## Notes & Decisions
- **Database Choice:** SQLite selected for simplicity and free deployment
- **ORM Choice:** Prisma for type safety and excellent SQLite support
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement 100ms delays between API calls (600 req/min buffer)
- **Caching Strategy:** Cache everything except current week transactions during season
- **Test Data:** Using Dynasty Domination league for development and testing
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Sleeper matchups endpoint provides individual player fantasy points - no external data sources needed!

## Blockers & Risks
- None identified at this time

## Success Metrics
- Successfully visualize transaction chains for test league
- Load full league history in < 5 seconds
- Mobile-responsive transaction tree visualization
- Clear UI requiring no documentation for basic use
