- **Rate Limit:** Under 1000 API calls per minute
- **Response Format:** JSON
- **Primary Focus:** NFL fantasy football data

## Critical API Insights

### 1. Timing & Timestamps

#### NFL State Endpoint
```
GET /v1/state/nfl
```
**Purpose:** Provides accurate season timing context for transaction timestamps

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "week": 1,
  "leg": 1, 
  "season": "2025",
  "season_type": "regular",
  "league_season": "2025",
  "previous_season": "2024",
  "season_start_date": "2025-09-04",
  "display_week": 1,
  "league_create_season": "2025",
  "season_has_scores": true
}
```

#### Draft Timing
Draft endpoints provide precise timestamps:
- `start_time`: When draft began (milliseconds)
- `last_picked`: Last pick timestamp
- `created`: Draft creation timestamp

### 2. Draft Pick Ownership Model (Three-Way Tracking)

**Key Discovery:** Draft picks track ownership through THREE IDs:

- **`roster_id`**: Original owner of the pick
- **`previous_owner_id`**: Who most recently traded it away
- **`owner_id`**: Current owner

**Example Chain:**
```
2025 R1 Pick: roster_1 ‚Üí roster_7 ‚Üí roster_8
- roster_id: 1 (original owner)
- previous_owner_id: 7 (traded it to current owner)
- owner_id: 8 (current owner)
```

This enables full reconstruction of multi-hop trade chains.

## Core Data Models

### 1. League Model

```json
{
  "league_id": "1191596293294166016",
  "name": "Dynasty Domination",
  "season": "2025",
  "status": "in_season",
  "sport": "nfl",
  "season_type": "regular",
  "previous_league_id": "1051592789462589440",
  "total_rosters": 12,
  "roster_positions": ["QB", "RB", "RB", "WR", "WR", "TE", "FLEX", "SUPER_FLEX", "BN", ...],
  "scoring_settings": {
    "rec": 0.5,
    "pass_td": 4.0,
    "rush_td": 6.0,
    "rec_td": 6.0,
    "pass_int": -2.0,
    "fum_lost": -1.0,
    // ... 50+ additional scoring fields
  },
  "settings": {
    "draft_rounds": 4,
    "num_teams": 12,
    "playoff_teams": 6,
    "pick_trading": 1,
    "trade_deadline": 11,
    // ... extensive league configuration
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `previous_league_id` enables dynasty continuity tracking
- Scoring settings are complex with 50+ fields
- Settings include trade deadlines and pick trading rules

### 2. Transaction Model

#### Trade Transaction
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "1254869151504142336",
  "type": "trade",
  "status": "complete", // or "failed"
  "created": 1753546629361, // millisecond timestamp
  "week": 1,
  "roster_ids": [7, 10],
  "consenter_ids": [7, 10],
  "adds": null, // or {"player_id": roster_id}
  "drops": null, // or {"player_id": roster_id}
  "draft_picks": [
    {
      "round": 3,
      "season": "2027",
      "roster_id": 10, // original owner
      "owner_id": 7, // current owner
      "previous_owner_id": 10 // who traded it
    }
  ],
  "waiver_budget": []
}
```

#### Waiver Transaction
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "1266215555392618498",
  "type": "waiver",
  "status": "complete",
  "created": 1756251822855,
  "adds": {"12474": 6}, // player_id: roster_id
  "drops": {"12542": 6},
  "settings": {
    "seq": 0,
    "waiver_bid": 21
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Transactions are fetched by week (1-18)
- `adds`/`drops` use player_id as key, roster_id as value
- Failed transactions are included and important for analysis
- Draft picks in trades include full ownership chain

### 3. Roster Model

```json
{
  "roster_id": 1,
  "owner_id": "233789917321228288",
  "league_id": "1191596293294166016",
  "players": ["10232", "11565", "11582", ...], // player ID strings
  "starters": ["6797", "11584", "5967", ...], // subset of players
  "settings": {
    "wins": 0,
    "losses": 0,
    "ties": 0,
    "fpts": 0, // total fantasy points
    "fpts_against": 0,
    "waiver_budget_used": 0,
    "waiver_position": 5
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Player IDs are strings, not integers
- Separate arrays for all players vs. starters
- Settings track wins/losses and FAAB usage

### 4. Draft Pick Models

#### Traded Picks (League Level)
```json
{
  "round": 1,
  "season": "2025",
  "roster_id": 1, // original owner
  "owner_id": 8, // current owner  
  "previous_owner_id": 7 // who traded it to current owner
}
```

#### Draft Selections
```json
{
  "draft_id": "1191596293294166017",
  "pick_no": 1,
  "round": 1,
  "draft_slot": 1,
  "roster_id": 9,
  "player_id": "12527",
  "picked_by": "718879062688366592",
  "metadata": {
    "first_name": "Ashton",
    "last_name": "Jeanty",
    "position": "RB",
    "team": "LV"
  }
}
```

### 5. User Model

```json
{
  "user_id": "233789917321228288",
  "username": "andrewduke23", 
  "display_name": "andrewduke23",
  "avatar": "1a5068c18f623797eb933ff43906521e",
  "is_owner": true,
  "metadata": {
    "team_name": "Who Needs Qbs",
    "allow_pn": "on",
    "transaction_trade": "on"
  }
}
```

### 6. Matchup Model ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FOR DYNASTY DNA**

```json
{
  "roster_id": 1,
  "matchup_id": 4,
  "points": 144.62, // TEAM TOTAL POINTS
  "players": ["10232", "11565", "2197", ...], // All roster players
  "starters": ["6797", "11584", "2197", ...], // Starting lineup
  "starters_points": [28.08, 12.4, 15.0, ...], // Individual starter points
  "players_points": {
    "10232": 7.5,  // Individual player fantasy points
    "11565": 1.42,
    "2197": 15.0,
    "3634": 2.42
    // ALL players with their weekly fantasy scores
  }
}
```

**üéØ GAME CHANGER:** The matchups endpoint provides **COMPLETE individual player fantasy scoring by week**! This enables full trade effectiveness analysis using only Sleeper data.

## Complete Fantasy Analysis Using Only Sleeper API! üéâ

### What Sleeper API Provides ‚úÖ
‚úÖ League structure and settings  
‚úÖ Transaction history (trades, waivers, etc.)  
‚úÖ Roster compositions over time  
‚úÖ Draft selections and pick trades  
‚úÖ Team-level matchup scores  
‚úÖ **Individual player fantasy points by week** (via matchups endpoint)  
‚úÖ **Starter vs bench performance tracking**  
‚úÖ **Complete trade effectiveness analysis capability**  

### What Sleeper API Does NOT Provide (Optional for Dynasty DNA)
‚ùì Raw NFL stats (yards, TDs, etc.) - not needed for our analysis  
‚ùì Advanced analytics beyond fantasy points - can be calculated  

### Dynasty DNA Can Now Deliver Complete Analysis
- **Phase 1:** Transaction chains, roster tracking, trade visualization, AND trade effectiveness
- **Phase 2:** Advanced analytics, "what-if" scenarios, manager performance metrics
- **No external data integration required** for core functionality!

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Synchronization

#### 1. League Discovery & Continuity
```javascript
// Fetch league chain
async function getLeagueChain(currentLeagueId) {
  const chain = [];
  let leagueId = currentLeagueId;
  
  while (leagueId) {
    const league = await fetch(`/v1/league/${leagueId}`);
    chain.push(league);
    leagueId = league.previous_league_id;
  }
  
  return chain.reverse(); // oldest to newest
}
```

#### 2. NFL State for Timestamps
```javascript
// Get season context
const nflState = await fetch('/v1/state/nfl');
const seasonStart = new Date(nflState.season_start_date);
```

#### 3. Transaction Synchronization
```javascript
// Fetch all transactions for a league
async function syncLeagueTransactions(leagueId) {
  const allTransactions = [];
  
  for (let week = 1; week <= 18; week++) {
    const weekTransactions = await fetch(`/v1/league/${leagueId}/transactions/${week}`);
    allTransactions.push(...weekTransactions);
  }
  
  return allTransactions;
}
```

#### 4. **CRITICAL: Player Weekly Scoring Synchronization**
```javascript
// Sync all player weekly scoring data
async function syncPlayerWeeklyScores(leagueId, season) {
  const allPlayerScores = [];
  
  // Fetch matchups for all weeks
  for (let week = 1; week <= 18; week++) {
    const matchups = await fetch(`/v1/league/${leagueId}/matchups/${week}`);
    
    for (const matchup of matchups) {
      const { roster_id, players_points, starters, starters_points } = matchup;
      
      // Store every player's weekly score
      for (const [playerId, points] of Object.entries(players_points)) {
        const isStarter = starters.includes(playerId);
        
        allPlayerScores.push({
          leagueId,
          playerId,
          rosterId: roster_id,
          week,
          season,
          points,
          isStarter
        });
      }
    }
  }
  
  return allPlayerScores;
}
```

### Phase 2: Draft Pick Chain Reconstruction

#### Algorithm for Multi-Hop Tracking
```javascript
function buildPickTradeChain(tradedPicks, transactions) {
  const chains = {};
  
  for (const pick of tradedPicks) {
    const key = `${pick.season}_R${pick.round}_${pick.roster_id}`;
    
    chains[key] = {
      originalOwner: pick.roster_id,
      currentOwner: pick.owner_id,
      immediateTrader: pick.previous_owner_id,
      // Find all transactions involving this pick
      transactions: findPickTransactions(pick, transactions)
    };
  }
  
  return chains;
}
```

### Phase 3: **Trade Effectiveness Analysis (Now Possible with Sleeper Data!)**

#### Calculate Actual Trade Value
```javascript
// Calculate actual fantasy points gained/lost in a trade
async function calculateTradeEffectiveness(tradeTransaction, playerScores) {
  const tradeDate = new Date(tradeTransaction.timestamp);
  const analysis = {
    tradedAway: [],
    tradedFor: [],
    netPointsGained: 0,
    weeksAnalyzed: 0
  };
  
  // Analyze performance after trade date
  for (const [playerId, rosterId] of Object.entries(tradeTransaction.adds || {})) {
    const playerPoints = playerScores
      .filter(score => 
        score.playerId === playerId && 
        new Date(score.week) > tradeDate
      )
      .reduce((sum, score) => sum + score.points, 0);
      
    analysis.tradedFor.push({ playerId, totalPoints: playerPoints });
  }
  
  for (const [playerId, rosterId] of Object.entries(tradeTransaction.drops || {})) {
    const playerPoints = playerScores
      .filter(score => 
        score.playerId === playerId && 
        new Date(score.week) > tradeDate
      )
      .reduce((sum, score) => sum + score.points, 0);
      
    analysis.tradedAway.push({ playerId, totalPoints: playerPoints });
  }
  
  // Calculate net gain
  const pointsGained = analysis.tradedFor.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.totalPoints, 0);
  const pointsLost = analysis.tradedAway.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.totalPoints, 0);
  analysis.netPointsGained = pointsGained - pointsLost;
  
  return analysis;
}
```

#### "What-If" Analysis
```javascript
// Calculate what points would have been if different lineup decisions were made
function calculateOptimalLineups(weeklyScores, rosterPositions) {
  return weeklyScores.map(week => {
    // Sort players by points for optimal lineup
    const sorted = week.playerScores.sort((a, b) => b.points - a.points);
    const optimal = selectOptimalStarters(sorted, rosterPositions);
    const actual = week.actualStarters;
    
    return {
      week: week.number,
      actualPoints: actual.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.points, 0),
      optimalPoints: optimal.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.points, 0),
      pointsLeftOnBench: optimal.totalPoints - actual.totalPoints
    };
  });
}
```

## Database Schema Updates Required

Based on API exploration, the following schema changes are needed:

### 1. Add Previous Owner Tracking
```prisma
model DraftPick {
  id              String @id @default(cuid())
  leagueId        String
  originalOwnerId String  // roster_id from API
  currentOwnerId  String  // owner_id from API  
  previousOwnerId String? // previous_owner_id from API - NEW FIELD
  year            Int
  round           Int
  pickNumber      Int?
  playerSelectedId String?
  traded          Boolean @default(false)
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### 2. Timestamp Storage
```prisma
model Transaction {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  leagueId    String
  type        String
  status      String
  week        Int?
  timestamp   BigInt   // Store millisecond timestamps
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### 3. NFL State Cache
```prisma
model NFLState {
  id              String @id @default(cuid()) 
  season          String @unique
  seasonType      String
  week            Int
  seasonStartDate DateTime
  lastUpdated     DateTime @default(now())
}
```

### 4. **CRITICAL: Player Weekly Scoring Models**
```prisma
model PlayerWeeklyScore {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  leagueId      String
  playerId      String
  rosterId      Int      // Which roster owned player this week
  week          Int
  season        String
  points        Float    // Fantasy points scored
  isStarter     Boolean  // Was player in starting lineup
  position      String?  // Position player was started in
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())

  league        League   @relation(fields: [leagueId], references: [id])
  player        Player   @relation(fields: [playerId], references: [id])

  @@unique([leagueId, playerId, week, season])
  @@map("player_weekly_scores")
}

model MatchupResult {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  leagueId      String
  rosterId      Int      // Sleeper roster ID
  week          Int
  season        String
  matchupId     Int      // Matchup ID from Sleeper
  totalPoints   Float    // Team total points
  opponentId    Int?     // Opposing roster ID
  won           Boolean? // Did this roster win the matchup
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())

  league        League   @relation(fields: [leagueId], references: [id])

  @@unique([leagueId, rosterId, week, season])
  @@map("matchup_results")
}
```

## Rate Limiting & Caching Strategy

### API Call Budget
- **Limit:** 1000 calls/minute
- **Strategy:** Implement 100ms delays (600 calls/minute buffer)
- **Priority:** Current week data > historical data

### Caching Approach
```javascript
const cacheStrategy = {
  // Cache forever
  permanent: [
    'completed seasons',
    'historical transactions', 
    'draft results'
  ],
  
  // Cache for 1 hour during season
  temporary: [
    'current week transactions',
    'active rosters',
    'NFL state'
  ],
  
  // Always fresh
  realtime: [
    'ongoing drafts',
    'pending trades'
  ]
};
```

## Real API Response Examples

### Failed Transaction
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "type": "waiver",
  "metadata": {
    "notes": "Unfortunately, your roster will have too many players after this transaction."
  },
  "created": 1756228510967,
  "transaction_id": "1266117778251726848"
}
```

### Draft Pick Only Trade
```json
{
  "type": "trade",
  "status": "complete", 
  "adds": null,
  "drops": null,
  "draft_picks": [
    {
      "round": 3,
      "season": "2027",
      "roster_id": 10,
      "owner_id": 7,
      "previous_owner_id": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complex Scoring Settings (Sample)
```json
{
  "rec": 0.5,
  "bonus_rec_te": 1.0,
  "bonus_rec_wr": 0.5, 
  "rush_fd": 0.5,
  "rec_fd": 0.5,
  "pass_td": 4.0,
  "pass_td_40p": 0.0,
  "rush_td": 6.0,
  "rec_td": 6.0,
  "pass_int": -2.0,
  "fum_lost": -1.0,
  "sack": 1.0,
  "ff": 1.0
}
```

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **String Player IDs:** Always treat player IDs as strings, not integers
2. **Failed Transactions:** Include failed transactions in analysis - they show intent
3. **Week-Based Fetching:** Must fetch transactions by week (1-18) individually  
4. **Dynasty Continuity:** Follow `previous_league_id` chain for full history
5. **Three-Way Pick Tracking:** Essential for accurate trade chain reconstruction
6. **Timestamp Context:** Use NFL state for accurate dating of events
7. **No Individual Scoring:** Plan for external data integration from day one

## Conclusion

The Sleeper API provides excellent data for transaction tracking, roster management, and league structure analysis. However, individual player performance data requires external integration. The three-way draft pick tracking system is sophisticated and enables complete reconstruction of complex multi-hop trades.

The API's structure aligns well with Dynasty DNA's core mission of tracking the "genetic makeup" of roster construction through detailed transaction chain analysis.
